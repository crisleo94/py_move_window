# Moving Windows

This application is made using the _windll_ module from [https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html](ctypes), detecting the opened applications then moving them whenever you want them to be. This can also be used as a "window position reminder"

# ToDo

- [ ] Structure the general application

- [ ] Separate functions to follow a specific flow, first find all opened applications, second filter the applications you want to "save" their current position

- [ ] Try to improve the code

- [ ] Use [https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html](tkinter) in order to create a simple interface to use the application for any opened application
