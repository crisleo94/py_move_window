# Moving Windows

This application is made using the _windll_ module from [https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html](ctypes), detecting the opened applications then moving them whenever you want them to be. This can also be used as a "window position reminder"

# ToDo

- [x] Structure the general application

- [x] Separate functions to follow a specific flow, first find all opened applications, second filter the applications you want to "save" their current position

- [x] Try to improve the code

- [x] Use [https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html](tkinter) in order to create a simple interface to use the application for any opened application - Basic structure is created

- [ ] Define grid structure

- [ ] Create find_windows function to make work from a tkinter button

- [ ] Create a label_span or any other tkinter widget in order to show a list of the windows
